# v0.7 — Self-Validation & Benchmark

Establish the benchmark suite that proves the system works.

- [ ] Benchmark project #1: Simple TODO CLI app (spec → working app)
- [ ] Benchmark project #2: REST API with database (spec → working app)
- [ ] Benchmark project #3: Anima iterates itself (self-improvement cycle)
- [ ] Stable/Candidate promotion mechanism for self-iteration
- [ ] Module health scoring (test coverage trend, change frequency, patch count)
- [ ] Auto-rewrite trigger: when module health score drops below threshold
