# v0.6 — Resilience & Self-Awareness

All 6 pipeline steps are now replaced by modules. Make the system "alive" —
it should sense its environment and adapt.

- [x] Rate limit awareness: executor reports quota state back to kernel
- [ ] Auto-sleep on quota exhaustion, auto-resume when quota recovers
- [ ] Failure pattern analysis: detect repeated failures on the same gap, skip or re-approach
- [ ] Gate mechanism: pause and request human approval on high-risk changes
- [ ] Health monitoring: track module performance vs seed baseline
- [ ] Graceful degradation: fall back to seed if a module starts failing
- [ ] All code passes full quality pipeline
