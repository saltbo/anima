# v0.2 — Core Modules (Gap Analyzer & Reporter)

Build the two modules with the simplest contracts first.

- [x] Implement gap_analyzer/core.py: reads Vision + ProjectState, outputs GapReport
- [x] Tests for gap_analyzer validating CONTRACT.md
- [x] Implement reporter/core.py: writes structured IterationRecord to iterations/
- [x] Tests for reporter validating CONTRACT.md
- [ ] Seed delegates gap analysis to gap_analyzer module (first self-replacement)
- [ ] Seed delegates reporting to reporter module (second self-replacement)
- [x] All code passes full quality pipeline
