# v0.2 — Core Modules (Gap Analyzer & Reporter)

Build the two modules with the simplest contracts first.

- [ ] Implement gap_analyzer/core.py: reads Vision + ProjectState, outputs GapReport
- [ ] Tests for gap_analyzer validating CONTRACT.md
- [ ] Implement reporter/core.py: writes structured IterationRecord to iterations/
- [ ] Tests for reporter validating CONTRACT.md
- [ ] Wire gap_analyzer into wiring.py with conformance test (first self-replacement)
- [ ] Wire reporter into wiring.py with conformance test (second self-replacement)
- [ ] All code passes full quality pipeline
