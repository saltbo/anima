# v0.2 — Scanner & Reporter (first self-replacements)

The simplest two pipeline steps. First experience of the self-replacement flow.

**Seed MVP (what exists today):**
- scan_project_state: walks directories, counts files, runs quality tools inline
- record_iteration: writes a flat JSON log file

**Module targets (what the agent builds — must exceed seed):**
- Scanner: structured ProjectState output, smarter file categorization,
  separate quality checking from scanning (scan should be fast)
- Reporter: structured IterationRecord matching domain/models.py,
  trend tracking across iterations, richer summaries

**Self-replacement flow:** implement → test → conformance test → wire → verify

- [ ] Implement modules/scanner/core.py with structured output
- [ ] Tests for scanner validating SPEC.md (behavior)
- [ ] Wire scan_project_state into wiring.py with conformance test validating CONTRACT.md (interface)
- [ ] Implement modules/reporter/core.py with structured IterationRecord
- [ ] Tests for reporter validating SPEC.md (behavior)
- [ ] Wire record_iteration into wiring.py with conformance test validating CONTRACT.md (interface)
- [ ] All code passes full quality pipeline
