# v0.1 — Foundation & Toolchain

Establish the type-safe foundation that all modules build on.
The seed drives all iterations at this stage.

- [x] Create complete directory structure matching VISION.md architecture
- [x] Implement domain/models.py with all core dataclasses (fully typed, frozen)
- [x] Implement domain/ports.py with all Protocol definitions
- [ ] Create CONTRACT.md for each module (scanner, gap_analyzer, planner, executor, verifier, reporter)
- [ ] Create SPEC.md for each module defining v0.1 target functionality
- [ ] Set up pytest with conftest.py and fixtures for common test patterns
- [x] All code passes: ruff check + ruff format + pyright strict + pytest
- [x] Verify that domain/ has zero external imports
