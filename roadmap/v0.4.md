# v0.4 — Verifier & Quality Gate

Build the verification module and integrate the full quality pipeline.

- [ ] Implement adapters/pytest_runner.py (PytestRunner implements TestRunnerPort)
- [ ] Implement adapters/quality_checker.py (RuffPyrightChecker implements LinterPort)
- [ ] Implement verifier/core.py: runs lint + typecheck + tests, produces VerificationReport
- [ ] Tests for verifier validating CONTRACT.md
- [ ] Seed delegates verification to verifier module (fifth self-replacement — seed is now minimal)
- [ ] Implement protected file detection (kernel/ and VISION.md cannot be modified by agent)
- [ ] All code passes full quality pipeline
