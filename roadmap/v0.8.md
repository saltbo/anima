# v0.8 — Self-Validation & Benchmark

Prove the system works on real projects, not just on itself.

- [x] Benchmark project #1: Simple CLI app (spec → working app in N iterations)
- [ ] Benchmark project #2: REST API with database (spec → working app)
- [x] Benchmark project #3: Anima improves its own modules (self-improvement cycle)
- [x] Module health scoring (test coverage trend, change frequency, failure rate)
- [x] Auto-rewrite trigger: when module health drops below threshold
