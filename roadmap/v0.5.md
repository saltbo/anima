# v0.5 — Kernel & Full Autonomy

Extract the kernel and achieve complete seed replacement.

- [x] Extract kernel/loop.py from seed.py iteration logic
- [x] Seed delegates to kernel/loop.py via wiring.py
- [x] System can iterate on its own modules (excluding kernel/)
- [x] Lifecycle state machine: alive (iterating) / sleep (idle) / paused (failed)
- [x] Continuous iteration by default; --once flag for single run
- [x] Auto-detect milestone advancement and create semver git tags (v0.1.0, v0.2.0, ...)
- [x] Commit and push to remote after every successful iteration
- [x] Update README.md status badges on state transitions
- [x] inbox/ monitoring: system detects and incorporates new .md files
- [x] Iteration rate limiting and cost tracking
- [ ] Gate mechanism: pause and request human approval on high-risk changes
- [ ] All code passes full quality pipeline
