# v0.5 — Verifier (protection & quality gate)

Replace the basic diff-checking with comprehensive verification.

**Seed MVP (what exists today):**
- verify_iteration: compares pre/post ProjectState dicts, runs ruff/pyright/pytest,
  checks for protected file modifications

**Module targets (what the agent builds — must exceed seed):**
- Granular quality reporting: per-file lint results, type error details
- Semantic diff analysis: understand what changed, not just that something changed
- Regression detection: did we break something that was working?
- Protected file enforcement with clear error messages
- Adapters: PytestRunner (TestRunnerPort), RuffPyrightChecker (LinterPort)

- [x] Implement adapters/pytest_runner.py (PytestRunner implements TestRunnerPort)
- [x] Implement adapters/quality_checker.py (RuffPyrightChecker implements LinterPort)
- [x] Implement modules/verifier/core.py with granular reporting
- [x] Tests for verifier validating SPEC.md (behavior)
- [x] Wire verify_iteration into wiring.py with conformance test validating CONTRACT.md (interface)
- [x] All code passes full quality pipeline
