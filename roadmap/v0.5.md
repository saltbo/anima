# v0.5 — Kernel & Full Autonomy

Extract the kernel and achieve complete seed replacement.

- [ ] Extract kernel/loop.py from seed.py iteration logic
- [ ] Extract kernel/rollback.py from seed.py git operations
- [ ] Extract kernel/config.py from seed.py configuration
- [ ] Seed script is now a thin entry point that calls kernel/loop.py
- [ ] System can iterate on its own modules (excluding kernel/)
- [ ] Lifecycle state machine: alive (iterating) / sleep (idle) / paused (failed)
- [ ] Continuous iteration by default; --once flag for single run
- [ ] Auto-detect milestone advancement and create semver git tags (v0.1.0, v0.2.0, ...)
- [ ] Commit and push to remote after every successful iteration
- [ ] Update README.md status badges (shields.io) on state transitions
- [ ] inbox/ monitoring: system detects and incorporates new .md files
- [ ] Gate mechanism: pause and request human approval on high-risk changes
- [ ] Iteration rate limiting and cost tracking
- [x] All code passes full quality pipeline
