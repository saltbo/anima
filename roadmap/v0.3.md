# v0.3 — Planner & Executor

Build the modules that drive the actual iteration work.

- [ ] Implement planner/core.py: receives GapReport + history, produces IterationPlan
- [ ] Tests for planner validating CONTRACT.md
- [ ] Implement adapters/agents/claude_code.py (ClaudeCodeAdapter implements AgentPort)
- [ ] Implement executor/core.py: takes IterationPlan, calls AgentPort, returns ExecutionResult
- [ ] Tests for executor validating CONTRACT.md (with mock AgentPort)
- [ ] Seed delegates planning to planner module (third self-replacement)
- [ ] Seed delegates execution to executor module (fourth self-replacement)
- [ ] All code passes full quality pipeline
