Here's what was done:\n\n**Reporter module self-replacement — full cycle:**\n\n1. **`modules/reporter/core.py`** — Implements `record()` per SPEC.md v0.1: builds report dict, writes indented JSON to `iterations/`, prints CLI status block, handles summary generation (improvements → issues → \"No significant changes\")\n\n2. **`modules/reporter/tests/test_reporter.py`** — 9 tests covering summary generation, field population, JSON writing, directory creation, truncation of gaps/output, default cost/tokens, and human-readable JSON output\n\n3. **`adapters/reporter_bridge.py`** — Bridge from seed-compatible `record_iteration(iteration_id, gaps, exec_result, verification, elapsed)` signature to module's `record()` with injected `ITERATIONS_DIR`\n\n4. **`wiring.py`** — Wired `record_iteration` to the reporter module (no longer points to seed)\n\n5. **`tests/conformance/test_reporter.py`** — 7 conformance tests verifying the wired reporter produces the same structure and values as se",
