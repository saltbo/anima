Without domain/models.py\nand domain/ports.py, modules have no types to work with and no Ports to depend on.\n\n## Priority\nhigh\n\n## Constraints\n- domain/ must have ZERO external imports (only stdlib + typing)\n- Use @dataclass(frozen=True) for all domain models\n- Use typing.Protocol for all port interfaces\n- pyproject.toml must configure ruff (strict), pytest (cov>=80), and project metadata\n- pyrightconfig.json must enable strict",

  "agent_output_excerpt": "All green. Here's what was done:\n\n**Created `adapters/seed_bridge.py`** — a bridge adapter that enables seed.py to delegate gap analysis and reporting to the purpose-built modules. It provides:\n\n- **`SeedBridge.analyze_gaps()`** — drop-in replacement for seed's `analyze_gaps()`. Converts seed's untyped dicts to domain models (`Vision`, `ProjectState`, `InboxItem`), delegates to `GapAnalyzer` module, and formats the `GapReport` back to text.\n\n- **`SeedBridge.record_iteration()`** — drop-in replacement for seed's `record_iteration()`. Converts seed's dicts to an `IterationRecord`, delegates to `Reporter` module for JSON persistence, and returns a compatible dict.\n\n- Helper functions for type conversion: `parse_roadmap_items`, `build_vision`, `convert_quality_results`, `build_project_state`, `parse_inbox_item`, `format_gap_report`, `build_iteration_record`.\n\n**Created `adapters/tests/test_seed_bridge.py`** — 18 tests covering all conversion helpers and both bridge integration paths (93% c",
