  "agent_output_excerpt": "Iteration #7 complete. Two v0.2 roadmap items checked off:\n\n1. **`modules/scanner/core.py`** — Implemented `scan(root: str) -> ProjectState` that mirrors the seed's `scan_project_state()` but returns structured domain types (`ProjectState`, `ModuleInfo`, `InboxItem`, `QualityReport`, `TestResult`) instead of a plain dict.\n\n2. **Scanner tests** — 17 tests in `modules/scanner/tests/test_scanner.py` validating SPEC.md behavior: file collection, directory skipping, module discovery, inbox reading, protected hash computation, and the full `scan()` integration.\n\nQuality gate: ruff check, ruff format, pyright — all clean. 39 tests passing.\n\nNext iteration should wire `scan_project_state` into `wiring.py` with a conformance test.",
