  "agent_output_excerpt": "v0.4 complete. Here's what was done in this iteration:\n\n**New files (5):**\n- `adapters/agents/claude_code.py` — `ClaudeCodeAdapter` implementing `AgentPort` with subprocess management, NDJSON stream parsing, cost/token extraction, and real-time output display\n- `adapters/executor_bridge.py` — Bridge adapter converting the typed executor interface to seed-compatible `execute_plan(prompt, dry_run)` signature\n- `modules/executor/core.py` — `Executor` class with `AgentPort` injection, dry-run mode, prompt persistence, and retry with exponential backoff (max 2 retries, skips retry on agent-not-found)\n- `modules/executor/tests/test_executor.py` — 10 tests covering dry-run, normal execution, retry logic, and cost/token passthrough\n- `tests/conformance/test_executor.py` — 6 conformance tests validating CONTRACT.md interface through wiring.py\n\n**Modified files (2):**\n- `wiring.py` — `execute_plan` now wired to `modules/executor` via `adapters/executor_bridge`\n- `modules/executor/SPEC.md` — Upda",
