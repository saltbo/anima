  "agent_output_excerpt": "## Iteration #18 complete\n\n**Roadmap item completed:** Auto-sleep on quota exhaustion, auto-resume when quota recovers\n\n**Approach:** The previous iterations were stuck because they tried to modify `kernel/loop.py` (immutable). The breakthrough was implementing the feature entirely within `wiring.py` — the agent-modifiable step registry.\n\n**What was built:**\n- `_get_quota_sleep_seconds()` — extracts sleep duration from execution results, handling both enum and string quota status values, with a configurable max cap (600s)\n- `_execute_with_fallback()` — factored out the execute+seed-fallback logic for reuse\n- `execute_plan()` — now wraps execution with quota-aware retry: if the first attempt returns a quota signal (rate-limited or exhausted), it sleeps for the appropriate duration then retries once. Transparent to the kernel loop.\n\n**Tests added:** 9 new tests covering:\n- `_get_quota_sleep_seconds` (no quota, OK status, rate-limited, exhausted, cap at max, enum handling)\n- `execute_plan",
