Added 6 wiring-level gate tests to `tests/test_wiring.py`:\n\n1. **High-risk prompt returns GATED result** — executor is NOT called\n2. **Low-risk prompt executes normally** — bypasses gating\n3. **Bypass after approval** — approved gates let high-risk plans through\n4. **Pending gate sleeps the loop** — `analyze_gaps` returns `NO_GAPS`\n5. **approve_iteration clears gate** — end-to-end approval flow\n6. **dry_run skips gate** — no classification on dry runs\n\nv0.6 gate mechanism: complete with module tests + wiring integration tests. All v0.6 roadmap items are now checked off.",
