All 6 pipeline steps have module implementations (`core.py`)\n  2. Each module is structurally complete (CONTRACT.md, SPEC.md, core.py, tests/)\n  3. Conformance tests exist for each pipeline step\n  4. `wiring.py` integrates adapter bridges (not just seed fallback)\n  5. Iteration metrics extracted from log history (success rate, cost, tokens)\n- **`benchmarks/tests/test_self_improvement.py`** — 20 tests covering each validation function, edge cases (malformed JSON, missing dirs), and an integration test against the real project\n- Updated `pyproject.toml` (testpat",
