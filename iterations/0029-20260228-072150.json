  "agent_output_excerpt": "Iteration #29 complete. Built **module health scoring** — the first v0.8 roadmap item.\n\n**What was done:**\n- Added 3 domain types to `domain/models.py`: `HealthStatus`, `ModuleHealthScore`, `HealthReport`\n- Created `modules/module_health/` with CONTRACT.md, SPEC.md, `core.py`, and 14 tests\n- `score_health()` computes per-module scores: 60% structural completeness (contract/spec/core/tests) + 40% runtime reliability (fallback rate from health.json)\n- Classifies each module as HEALTHY (≥0.7), DEGRADED (≥0.4), or CRITICAL (<0.4)\n- Integrated into `wiring.py` via `get_module_health()` with graceful fallback\n- All 362 tests pass, 99% coverage, ruff + pyright clean\n\n**v0.8 progress:** 1/5 items complete. Next up: auto-rewrite trigger (depends on this health scoring).",
