  "agent_output_excerpt": "## Iteration #31 Summary\n\n**Root cause identified and fixed**: The health monitoring system was fundamentally broken — it only tracked failures (`_record_fallback`) but never tracked successes, making all module fallback rates permanently 100%. This false signal triggered the auto-rewrite mechanism on every iteration, masking the fact that all modules were working correctly.\n\n**Changes made:**\n\n1. **`wiring.py`** — Added `_record_success(step)` function and called it on every successful module execution across all 6 pipeline steps. The health system now accurately tracks both successful calls and fallbacks.\n\n2. **`modules/scanner/core.py`** — Excluded `__pycache__` from module discovery. It was being detected as a degraded module (missing CONTRACT.md, SPEC.md, etc.) because it's not a module at all.\n\n3. **`tests/conftest.py`** — Added global `autouse` fixture to isolate all tests from the real `.anima/health.json`. Previously, test runs (especially `TestGracefulDegradation`) were writi",
