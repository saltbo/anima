Here's what was done:\n\n**Roadmap item completed:** Wire `scan_project_state` into `wiring.py` with conformance test\n\n**Changes made:**\n1. **`adapters/scanner_bridge.py`** (new) — Bridge adapter that calls `modules.scanner.core.scan()` and converts the structured `ProjectState` dataclass back to the `dict[str, Any]` format that `kernel/loop.py` and downstream seed functions expect\n2. **`wiring.py`** — Replaced `scan_project_state = seed.scan_project_state` with import from `adapters.scanner_bridge` — Anima's first self-replacement\n3. **`tests/conformance/test_scanner.py`** (new) — 5 conformance tests validating:\n   - Wiring resolves to a callable and is not the seed\n   - Return dict has all keys expected by loop.py, verify_iteration, and analyze_gaps\n   - Detects same architectural layers, modules, and protected file hashes as seed\n4. **`roadmap/v0.2.md`** — Checked off the completed item\n\n**Verification:** `ruff check` + `ruff format --check` + `pyright` (0 error",
