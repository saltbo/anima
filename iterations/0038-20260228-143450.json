Found 4 Clean Architecture violations and created `roadmap/v1.1.md` to track fixes.\n\n**Issues found:**\n\n| Module | Violation | Import |\n|--------|-----------|--------|\n| `gap_analyzer/core.py` | imports kernel + sibling module | `kernel.roadmap`, `modules.failure_analyzer` |\n| `planner/core.py` | imports kernel | `kernel.roadmap.get_current_version` |\n| `executor/core.py` | imports kernel | `kernel.config.ROOT` |\n| `reporter/core.py` | imports kernel | `kernel.console` |\n\nThese violate the core architecture rule: **modules/ depend only on domain/**. The roadmap items were checked off, but the implementations took shortcuts by reaching into kernel/ directly instead of receiving dependencies through injection.\n\n**New roadmap:** `roadmap/v1.1.md` — Architecture Compliance & Structural Integrity\n- Fix all 4 module dependency violations via parameter/constructor injection",
