  "agent_output_excerpt": "**Iteration #17 complete.** Here's what was done:\n\n**Graceful degradation + Health monitoring** — checked off 3 v0.6 roadmap items:\n\n1. **`wiring.py` rewritten** with try/except fallback for all 6 pipeline steps. If any module import or execution fails, the system transparently falls back to the corresponding seed implementation instead of crashing.\n\n2. **Health monitoring** via `.anima/health.json` — fallback events are recorded with step name, error message, error type (import vs runtime), and timestamp. Module stats track fallback counts per step. `get_health_stats()` API exposes this data.\n\n3. **\"All code passes full quality pipeline\"** confirmed — ruff, pyright, pytest all pass clean (201 tests, 99.25% coverage).\n\n**v0.6 roadmap status** — 5/7 items complete, 2 remaining:\n- `[ ]` Auto-sleep on quota exhaustion (requires kernel/loop.py changes)\n- `[ ]` Gate mechanism (requires kernel/loop.py changes)",
