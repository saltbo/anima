# VISION: Anima

**Anima** (Latin: "soul, life force") is an Autonomous Iteration Engine — a system
that gives software projects a life of their own through continuous, goal-driven,
self-directed development cycles.

Anima is also **its own first user**. It builds itself through the same autonomous
iteration process it provides to others. When Anima reaches maturity, its every
release will have been produced by itself.
