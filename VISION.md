# Vision: Anima

## Identity

**Anima** (Latin: "soul, life force") is an Autonomous Iteration Engine —
a desktop application that gives software projects a life of their own.

Anima is also **its own first user**. It builds itself through the same
autonomous iteration process it provides to others.

## Problem

Software projects are inert. They only evolve when developers actively push
them forward. The moment attention shifts elsewhere, the project stagnates.
Bugs pile up. Feature requests go unaddressed. The gap between where the
project is and where it should be keeps growing.

## Audience

Developers and indie makers who want their projects to keep moving forward —
even when they're not watching.

## Long-term Goal

Every software project that uses Anima becomes a living entity: it senses
feedback from the outside world, plans its own evolution, executes changes
through AI agents, and ships — continuously, autonomously, without waiting
for a human to pick up the keyboard.

The end state: a project that wakes up, works, and goes back to sleep —
on its own.
